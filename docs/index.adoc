== Introduction

This small library implements a recent variation of the old idea of tag
dispatching in C++:

It's seen various uses over the ages. Some of which have been subsumed by
`constexpr` constructs. This relatively new formulation attempts to solve the old
generic programming problem of providing a way to customize some library
functionality from the outside deep inside that library. The recent usage was
introduced by the WG21 link:https://wg21.link/p1895r0[P1895] paper
(tag_invoke: A general pattern for supporting customisable functions).

This particular implementation was inspired by Gašper Ažman's presentation;
link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_bijOA1jts['tag_invoke' - An Actually Good Way to Do Customization Points].

Like most techniques in C++, it's only a tool. Once that can be both beneficial
and dangerous depending on how it's used. A goal of this utility, and the
`tag_dispatch` approach is to reduce the dangers while keeping the benefits.
